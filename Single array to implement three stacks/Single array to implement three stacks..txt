Single array to implement three stacks

1- First of all decide how big each stack will be.
	i.e:
	    If the size of each stack is 6 then size of array will be 18
2- Define the Staring point of each stack in array

3- For push(), define what value to be pushed and at which stack
	i.e: push(int StackNo, Value)

4- For pop(), give argument from which stack to pop
	i.e: pop(int StackNo)
